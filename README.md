# code-splitting-example

So I followed this excellent guide on [Code Splitting with Webpack & React Router](http://brotzky.co/blog/a-beginners-step-by-step-guide-to-code-splitting-with-webpack-2-and-react-router/) by [@brotzky](https://github.com/brotzky) and copied all this code to test it locally. Saving this in my repo for future reference. Hope he doesn't mind :)
